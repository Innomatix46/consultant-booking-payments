# Architecture Decision Records (ADRs)
## Payment System Design Decisions

### ADR-001: Provider Abstraction Pattern

**Date**: 2024-01-01
**Status**: Accepted
**Context**: Need to support multiple payment providers (Stripe, Paystack) while maintaining flexibility for future providers.

**Decision**: Implement a Provider Abstraction Pattern with a common interface that all payment providers must implement.

**Rationale**:
- Enables easy switching between providers
- Allows running multiple providers simultaneously
- Simplifies testing with mock providers
- Reduces vendor lock-in
- Provides consistent API regardless of underlying provider

**Consequences**:
- ✅ Simplified provider switching and failover
- ✅ Consistent developer experience
- ✅ Enhanced testability
- ❌ Additional abstraction layer complexity
- ❌ Some provider-specific features may not be exposed

**Implementation**:
```javascript
// Common interface for all providers
class PaymentProvider {
  async createPaymentIntent(params) { /* ... */ }
  async confirmPaymentIntent(id, params) { /* ... */ }
  // ... other common methods
}

// Provider-specific implementations
class StripeProvider extends PaymentProvider { /* ... */ }
class PaystackProvider extends PaymentProvider { /* ... */ }
```

- Allows for eventual consistency patterns
- Supports audit trails and monitoring

**Consequences**:
- ✅ High reliability and fault tolerance
- ✅ Horizontal scalability
- ✅ Built-in retry mechanisms
- ❌ Increased system complexity
- ❌ Eventual consistency challenges

**Implementation**:
```
Webhook Request → Validator → Event Router → Message Queue → Event Processor → Database
                                     ↓
                              Dead Letter Queue
```

### ADR-003: Database Schema Design for Multi-Provider Support

**Date**: 2024-01-01
**Status**: Accepted
**Context**: Need to store payment data from multiple providers while maintaining consistency and auditability.

**Decision**: Use a unified schema with provider-specific fields and external ID mapping.

**Rationale**:

- Enables cross-provider analytics and reporting
- Maintains referential integrity
- Supports complete audit trails
- Allows for provider migration

**Consequences**:
- ✅ Unified reporting and analytics
- ✅ Strong data consistency
- ✅ Complete audit trails
- ❌ Schema complexity for provider differences
- ❌ Potential storage overhead

**Schema Design**:
```sql
payment_intents:
  - id (internal)
  - external_id (provider's ID)
  - provider (enum: stripe, paystack)
  - amount, currency, status
  - metadata (JSON for provider-specific data)
```

- Protection against data breaches
- Zero-trust security model
- Regulatory compliance (GDPR, etc.)
- Industry best practices

**Consequences**:
- ✅ High security posture
- ✅ Compliance with regulations
- ✅ Customer trust and confidence
- ❌ Performance overhead for encryption
- ❌ Increased complexity for key management

**Implementation**:
- AES-256-GCM encryption for sensitive data
- TLS 1.3 for all communications
- JWT with short expiration for authentication
- Regular key rotation and HSM usage

### ADR-005: API Gateway Pattern for Request Management

**Date**: 2024-01-01
**Status**: Accepted
**Context**: Need centralized request handling, rate limiting, authentication, and routing.

**Decision**: Implement API Gateway pattern as the single entry point for all payment operations.

**Rationale**:
- Centralized authentication and authorization
- Consistent rate limiting and DDoS protection
- Request/response validation and transformation
- Centralized logging and monitoring
- Service discovery and load balancing

**Consequences**:
- ✅ Centralized security and monitoring
- ✅ Consistent API experience
- ✅ Easy to implement cross-cutting concerns
- ❌ Single point of failure (mitigated with HA)
- ❌ Additional latency for request processing

**Architecture**:
```
Client → API Gateway → Payment Service → Provider Services
              ↓
        Auth, Rate Limiting, Validation, Logging
```

### ADR-006: Idempotency Keys for Operation Safety

**Date**: 2024-01-01
**Status**: Accepted
**Context**: Payment operations must be safe from duplicate execution due to network failures or retries.

**Decision**: Implement idempotency keys for all mutating payment operations.

**Rationale**:
- Prevents duplicate charges from network retries
- Ensures operation safety in distributed systems
- Enables safe retry mechanisms
- Industry standard practice
- Required for financial compliance

**Consequences**:
- ✅ Safe retry mechanisms
- ✅ Prevention of duplicate charges
- ✅ Better client experience
- ❌ Additional complexity in request handling
- ❌ Storage overhead for idempotency tracking

**Implementation**:
```javascript
// Store idempotency keys with operation results
const idempotencyKey = req.headers['idempotency-key'];
const existingResult = await getIdempotencyResult(idempotencyKey);
if (existingResult) {
  return res.json(existingResult);
}
```

### ADR-007: Circuit Breaker Pattern for Provider Failover

**Date**: 2024-01-01

class PaymentOrchestrator {
  async processPayment(params) {
    for (const provider of this.getActiveProviders()) {
      if (this.circuitBreaker.isOpen(provider)) continue;
      
      try {
        return await provider.createPaymentIntent(params);
      } catch (error) {
        this.circuitBreaker.recordFailure(provider);
      }
    }
