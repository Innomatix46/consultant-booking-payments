  console.log(JSON.stringify({
    type: 'SECURITY_EVENT',
    event,
    details,
    timestamp: new Date().toISOString(),
    userAgent: req.headers['user-agent'],
    ip: req.headers['x-forwarded-for'] || req.connection.remoteAddress
  }));
}
```

## Emergency Procedures

### Security Incident
1. **Immediate Response**
   ```bash
   # Disable affected functions
   vercel env rm COMPROMISED_API_KEY production
   
   # Roll back to safe deployment
   vercel rollback
   
   # Review logs
   vercel logs --since=24h | grep ERROR
   ```
